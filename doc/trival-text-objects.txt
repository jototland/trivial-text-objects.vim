*trivial-text-objects.txt* Absolutely trivial but still useful text objects.

INTRODUCTION

This plugin defines three text objects with mappings for the non-blank part of
the current line, the whole line, and the whole buffer

PLUG-MAPPINGS      *<plug>(inside-line)* *<plug>(around-line)* *<plug>(entire-buffer)*

There following text object plug mappings are defined for operator-pending
mode and visual mode.
    
    |<plug>(inside-line)|

|<plug>(inside-line)| selects the part of the line from first nonblank
character, to and including the last nonblank character.

It also accepts a |count|. When a count greater than 1 is given, it will select
|count| lines, starting from current line.

    |<plug>(around-line)|

|<plug>(around-line)| selects the whole line, including end of line character.

It also accepts a |count|. When a count greater than 1 is given, it will select
|count| lines, starting from current line.

    |<plug>(entire-buffer)|

|<plug>(entire-buffer)| selects the entire buffer.

DEFAULT MAPPINGS                                                   *il* *al* *i%* *a%*

In addition to the plug mappings the following mappings are defined for
operator-pending mode and visual mode.

    |il|	|<plug>(inside-line)|
    |al|	|<plug>(around-line)|
    |i%|	|<plug>(entire-buffer)|
    |a%|	|<plug>(entire-buffer)|
    
CONFIGURATION                            *g:trivial_text_objects_no_default_map*

If you do not want the default mappings, put
